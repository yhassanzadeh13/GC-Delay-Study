# Logs
In this folder are the histograms that were created from the data. 
## Logs from the test carried out using RMI calls. The data has been taken from the "Test 3 - 4k Messages" with 32 nodes.
### Figure 1
Figure 1 is the histogram of the average RTT delay between every pair of nodes. A normal distribution has been fitted to the histogram.

### Figure 2
Figure 2 is the CDF of the RTT delays between every pair of nodes, with a normal distribution fitted onto it.

### Figure 3
Figure 3 is the histogram of all the individual RTT delays logged between one pair of nodes. A normal, poisson, as well as an exponential distribution have been fitted onto the histogram.

### Figure 4
Figure 4 is the CDF of all the recorded RTT delays between one pair of nodes, with normal, poisson, and exponential distributions fit onto it. 

## Logs from the test carried out using ICMP echo Request messages.
### Figure 5
Figure 5 is the histogram of the average RTT delay between every pair of nodes. A normal distribution has been fitted to the histogram.

### Figure 6
Figure 6 is the CDF of the RTT delays between every pair of nodes, with a normal distribution fitted onto it.

## Logs collected from the WonderNetwork ping logs.
### Figure 7
Figure 7 is the histogram of the average RTT delay between every pair of locations/cities. A normal distribution has been fitted to the histogram.

### Figure 8
Figure 8 is the CDF of the RTT delays between every pair of locations/cities, with a normal distribution fitted onto it.
