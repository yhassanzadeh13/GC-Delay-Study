# Logs
In this folder are the histograms that were created from the data. All the data has been taken from the "Test 3 - 4k Messages" with 32 nodes.
### Figure 1
Figure 1 is the histogram of the average RTT delay between every pair of nodes. A normal distribution has be fitted to the histogram.

### Figure 2
Figure 2 is the CDF of the RTT delays between every pair of nodes, with a normal distribution fitted onto it.

### Figure 3
Figure 3 is the histogram of all the individual RTT delays logged between one pair of nodes. A normal, poisson, as well as an exponential distribution have been fitted onto the histogram.

### Figure 4
Figure 4 is the CDF of all the recorded RTT delays between one pair of nodes, with normal, poisson, and exponential distributions fit onto it.
